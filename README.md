# hyperion-client
Java based Client for <a href=" https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion">hyperion</a>

If you plan to use this client for movie/TV show ambilight, I suggest to use <a href="https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion/wiki/XBMC-addon-(not-for-RPi)">XBMC/KODI addon<a> instead.

If yout plan to use this on linux, i suggest to use hyperion-x11 or boblight-x11.

If you need a dirty client for dirty work in Windows you can give it a try.

The main purpose of this client is online streaming and gaming (sadly some d3d games won't work with current grabbers).
